Do you have an event calendar plugin, and want to suggest some programs connected to an article? Do you have a custom movie catalog plugin and want to associate some articles to your movies?

Using cross type relationship management functions, WRI makes it possible to associate a post, page, or other custom post type to other posts, pages or custom post types, ensures widely configurable relatedness settings, sophisticated cross-relation adjustments.

You can set attributes that define how to display different type of related items for every reference item type. Such a matrix-like way you can specify all necessary variations of display settings.
